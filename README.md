Minimum Cost Flow:
In the case study from Guéret et al, (1999), the Minimum Cost Flow Problem  was solved to minimise the company’s costs when transferring the required number of cars to different
collection points along all arcs of the network, subject to satisfy the demand of each point. The decisions to be made are whether or not each source i will be able to supply
destination j. The input parameters to be considered are the following: unit transportation charge, fixed price transportation, and demand at destination j.
